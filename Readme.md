Multi-Stage Classification - Cancer Metastasis
Breast cancer, as a primary tumour, is well-know to cause secondary tumours in brain, bone, liver
and lung. The datasets, obtained from Gene Ex-pression Omnibus (GEO), having accession number
GSE 14020 contains 65 samples of dierent metas-tases of Breast Cancer. Specifically, these samples
are divided in two series matrix Samples (GPL96 and GPL570) having different dimensions. GPL96 have
36 samples and 22,283 genes. Whereas, GPL570 have 29 samples and 54,675 genes.
Given that X = x1,x2,x3.... xN presents the list of genes and y1 = Brain; y2 Bone; y3 Liver; y4 Lung
presents the location of metastases, you are to devise a framework looking at a
new data point X one can give appropriate prog-
nosis of its most likely location i.e., Y . Dataset can be accessed at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14020
